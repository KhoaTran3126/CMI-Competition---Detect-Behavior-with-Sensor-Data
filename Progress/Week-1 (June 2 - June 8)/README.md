# Week 1 Progress

## General Questions
1. How can demographics data be incorporated into train? Can I utilize distance measures in demographics data to enhance my predictions? Does handedness matter?
2. What are the relationships of each feature to the prediction of gesture?
3. Can I condense information of acceleration, temperature, time-of-flight, and rotation sensors' data? 
4. Amongst other predictive features, **orientation** and **behavior** features are **not present in test set**. Are they predictive of gesture at all? Is it possible to infer them? How?
5. What can I use **sequence_counter** for, aside that it indicates a new subject's action?
